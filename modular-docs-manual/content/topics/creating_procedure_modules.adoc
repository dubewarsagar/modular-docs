= Procedure modules

Procedure modules explain how to do something. A procedure module contains numbered, step-by-step instructions to help users accomplish a single task. Sometimes those tasks include substeps. Procedure modules must include a title, a brief introduction, and one or more steps in the form of imperative statements. Procedure modules can also contain the following sections:

* xref:limitations[]
* xref:prerequisites[]
* xref:verification[]
* xref:troubleshooting[]
* xref:next-steps[]
* xref:additional-resources[]

Do not change or embellish these subheadings. Unless absolutely necessary, do not create additional subheadings.

.Procedure title
The title of a procedure module is a gerund phrase, such as *Deploying OpenShift Container Platform*.

.Procedure introduction
The procedure introduction is a short paragraph that provides an overview of the module. The introduction includes what the module will help the user do and why it will be beneficial to the user. It includes key words that relate to the module to maximize search engine optimization.

The introduction typically provides context for the procedure, such as:

* Why and where the user performs the procedure
* Special considerations specific to the procedure

For details and examples, see the link:https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/#shortdesc[Short descriptions] section in the Red&nbsp;Hat supplementary style guide.

[id="prerequisites"]
.Prerequisites
This section is optional. Prerequisites are a bulleted list of conditions that must be satisfied before the user starts the procedure. Use a bulleted list for prerequisites and the plural heading *Prerequisites*, even if your procedure only has a single prerequisite.

Prerequisites can be full sentences or sentence fragments; however, prerequisite list items must be parallel.

Focus on relevant prerequisites that users might not otherwise be aware of. Do not list obvious prerequisites. If a prerequisite applies to all of the procedures in a user story, consider listing the prerequisite in the assembly file. If you do this, consider including the prerequisite in the procedure module as a comment.

[id="procedure"]
.Procedure
This section is required. The procedure consists of one or more steps required to complete the procedure. Each step describes one action written in the imperative form, for example, 'Do this action'. For single-step procedures, use an unnumbered bullet instead of a numbered list.

NOTE: Not all numbered lists in documentation are procedures. You can also use numbered lists in any module type for non-procedural sequences, such as a process flow of system actions.

[id="verification"]
.Verification
This section is optional. It provides the user with one or more steps to verify that the procedure provided the intended outcome, for example:

* An example of expected command output or a pop-up window that the user receives when the procedure is successful
* Actions for the user to complete, such as entering a command, to determine the success or failure of the procedure

[id="troubleshooting"]
.Troubleshooting
This section is optional and not used often. List any actions that can help with troubleshooting the procedure. This subsection should be short. Consider whether the information might be better in a separate troubleshooting procedure or as part of a reference module that contains other troubleshooting sections.

[id="next-steps"]
.Next steps
This section is optional. Provide links to resources that contain instructions that might be useful to the user after they complete this procedure.

NOTE: Do not use *Next steps* to provide a second list of instructions.

[id="additional-resources"]
.Additional resources
This section is optional. The listed resources link to other material closely related to the contents of the module, such as other documentation resources, instructional videos, or labs.

Focus on relevant resources that might interest the user. Do not list resources for completeness. If a resource applies to all of the modules in a user story, consider listing the resource in the Additional resources section of the assembly file. If you do this, consider including the resource in the procedure module as a comment.
